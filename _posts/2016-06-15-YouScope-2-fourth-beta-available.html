title: Fourth beta of YouScope 2.0 available
---
<p>We just released the fourth beta version of YouScope 2.0. In this beta, it is now possible to fully define how measurement data (images, meta-data) should be saved to the disk, by so called "custom save settings" (under Tools menu). Besides this, we fixed several smaller bugs.

<p>The fourth beta is stable, meaning that we recommend switching right now! You can download the latest release of Youscope in our <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/download.html">download area</a>.

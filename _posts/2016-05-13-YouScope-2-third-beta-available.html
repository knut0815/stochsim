title: Third beta of YouScope 2.0 available
---
<p>We just released the third beta version of YouScope 2.0. Besides several smaller bugfixes, we added support to measure cell sizes or similar in the LiveStream. Furthermore, support for SLIM microscopy as well as droplet based microfluidics was significantly extended. Also, a new red skin is available, supposingly being good for the eyes when starring at the screen for hours in a dark microscopy chamber.
<p>The third beta is stable, meaning that we recommend switching right now! You can download the latest release of Youscope in our <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/download.html">download area</a>.

title: YouScope R2016 (v2.0.0) finally released
---
<p>After hard work, we finally released today the stable build of YouScope R2016 (v2.0.0). The last beta (Beta 6) proved stable and ready for productive use.<br />

Most new features of R2016 were already available (and extensively tested) in the pre-releases. The highlights contain support for completely customizable non-regular microplates and -chips, easier configurable measurements, extended support for microfluidics, the possibility to edit measurements while running in a controlled way, and various new job types allowing to further customize imaging protocols. We recommend switching to R2016 to all users!

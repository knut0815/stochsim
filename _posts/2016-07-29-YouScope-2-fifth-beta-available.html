title: Fifth beta of YouScope 2.0 available
---
<p>We just released the fifth beta version of YouScope 2.0. In this beta, we introduce new path optimizers for microplate measurements. These optimizers are 1.5- and 2-approximations of the traveling salesman problem, thus, typically return very good or even the optimal paths through the microplate. 
<b>Important Note:</b> The last beta release of YouScope (R2016 Beta 4) contained a serious bug which might lead to loss of data (overweiting of images during a measurement) when imaging different wells of a microplate havind different y-positions, but the same x-position. In this bug, the file-name generated by default for new images only includes the identifier of the y-position, but not of the x-position. We strongly recommend that anybody using the Beta 4 either switches to the new Beta 5 version, or downgrades to Beta 3. All versions can be found in our <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/download.html">download area</a>.

<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>Before you contact us with a question, please read the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> and the <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/documentation.html">Documentation</a> if your question might already be answered there.</p>
<h2>Bugs and Feature Requests</h2>
<p>
	YouScope is hosted on GitHub. As such, the easiest way to report bugs, feature requests, and similar is to create a so called &quot;issue&quot;, which you can do here:
	<a href="https://github.com/langmo/youscope/issues" target="_blank">https://github.com/langmo/youscope/issues</a>
</p>
<p>
	The GitHub &quot;issue&quot; system has the advantage that it is easier to track issues, as well as that other users can comment on these issues. Thus, we prefer issues over e-mails, even though you can still write us an e-mail if you prefer to do so.
</p>
<h2>Contact by E-Mail</h2>
<p>We are interested in your user-experience with YouScope. If you are using YouScope and are happy with it &ndash; tell us! If you found a bug, miss a feature, or even stopped using YouScope for one or the other reason &ndash; then there is even more reason to tell us!
<br />We constantly try to improve YouScope, but this will only lead to success if you tell us what you like, and what you don't.</p>

		<a href="javascript:minimizeMaximize('general_why');"><img src="{{ site.github.url }}/img/plus.gif" class="faq" id="general_why-plusMinus" />Why did you develop stochsim?</a>
		<div class="faq" id="general_why">
			<p>We developed stochsim as part of a scientific publication about multiple infections during dynamic interactions between bacteria and phages (bacterial viruses).
			This project required stochastic simulations where reactions either fire at exponentially distributed times or after fixed times, as well as the ability to assign properties in form of double values to individual elements of a species.
			Since no other stochastic simulator offered this ability and was, at the same time, capable to run simulations with billions of elements of each species, stochsim was born.

			<p>We try to reduce the number of bugs and errors as much as possible. However, there exist no complex software products for which it can be guaranteed that they are error-free.

		<div class="faq" id="conf_general">
			<p>Stochsim is written in C++ and only uses the C++ standard libraries. It should therefore be possible to compile stochsim for every common operating system/platform. However, due to time restrictions, we only provide compiled versions (releases) of stochsim for Windows. If you are using a different operating system, you have to compile stochsim yourself.</p>

<h2>Features / Services</h2>

		<a href="javascript:minimizeMaximize('feat_general');"><img src="{{ site.github.url }}/img/plus.gif" class="faq" id="feat_general-plusMinus" />General Remarks</a>
		<div class="faq" id="feat_general">
			<p>We would like that many people are able to use stochsim, for many &ndash;even specific&ndash; research or even economic proposes. Thus, we are interested to steadily improve the functionality of stochsim. However, please understand that stochsim is free-of-charge and that we do not earn any money with stochsim. Thus, the fulfilment of any feature request or similar are conditioned on that we find time to implement them. Also, try to pose any request as general as possible. Your chances that we implement the requested feature are the higher, the more like the feature can be used by a broad audience.</p>

	  <li>
		<a href="javascript:minimizeMaximize('feat_request');"><img src="{{ site.github.url }}/img/plus.gif" class="faq" id="feat_request-plusMinus" />Request a Feature / Service</a>
		<div class="faq" id="feat_request">
			<p>You are welcome to send us any feature request or ask us for any service you want connected to stochsim (see general remarks). How to contact us we describe in the <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/contact.html">contact section</a>. However, before requesting a feature, you should ask yourself if you might even be able to include your feature on your own (see below).<br />
			To request a feature it would be nice to include the following information in the request:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Describe the feature in as general terms as possible.</li>
				<li>Describe where you think the feature should be integrated, or how you would like to interact with this feature.</li> 
				<li>Include if you think this feature might be interesting for other users, too, and who might be these users. This can significantly increase the chance that the requested feature is actually implemented by us.</li>
				<li>If there is another program which already has a similar feature, name it.</li>
				<li>And, most important, provide us with your contact information in case we might have questions about the request.</li>

		<div class="faq" id="feat_diy">
			<p>Stochsim is open-source and organized in a modular, extensible way. This allows to simply increase its functionality by editing/adding few source files. You are welcome to clone the stochsim repository and add any feature you need yourself!</p>

		<div class="faq" id="feat_publish">
			<p>Stochsim is provided free of charge. If you have extended stochsim by a feature which might be usefull for others, too, think about giving back something to the community by publishing this feature.</p>

		<div class="faq" id="feat_develop">
			<p>Stochsim is not only free, but also open-source. This means that you can download and manipulate the source code of stochsim (for more details, see <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/documentation.html">documentation section</a>). Instead of manipulating Stochsim on your own, it would be better to join the development group of stochsim and help us to prepare the next official release.
			If you want to join the development team, contact us (see <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/contact.html"> contact page</a>)</p>

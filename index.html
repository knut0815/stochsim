<p>
Stochsim is a fast and versatile stochastic simulator. The simulator is written in C++, but also offers a convenient Matlab interface.
Different to many other stochastic simulators, stochsim provides functionality for
<ul>
	<li>both propensity and fixed time delay reactions (reactions firing a pre-defined time after a molecule was created).</li>
	<li>custom reaction rate/propensity definitions to implement non-mass action kinetic reactions (e.g. logarithmic growth).</li>
	<li>assigning-if required-a unique identity to each molecule of a species/state, for example to count the number of how often a given molecule participated in a reaction as a catalyst.</li>
	<li>probabilistic outcomes of reactions, e.g. A->B with probability 0.1, and A->C otherwise. This is especially useful when combined with fixed time delay reactions, or with molecules having each a unique identity (probabilities can depend on this identity).</li>
</ul>
The stochsim simulator can be accessed in three different ways:
<ul>
	<li>Directly adding the C++ source and header files, respectively the compiled static libraries and the header files, to a C++ project, and configuring and running the simulation directly via C++.</li>
	<li>Via a Matlab (mex) interface, mapping the C++ class structure directly to a (simplified) Matlab class structure which provides nearly the same capabilities as the C++ interface.</li>
	<li>By calling a provided standalone executable and providing the simulation configuration as an argument.</li>
</ul>
A simulation/model can be configured in two different ways:
<ul>
	<li>Directly via the native or Matlab interface by calling the respective functions.</li>
	<li>Via a cmdl model file, which is essentially a simple mini-language allowing to describe a stochsim model in an intuitive way (see below). </li>
</ul>
